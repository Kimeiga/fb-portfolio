### Major Issues: 0

### Minor Issues: 1

#### Issue #1: Comment User Display Name Shows "Unknown User" ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED

**Expected**: Should show "Alice", "Bob", etc. (the display_name from the user)
**Actual**: Shows "Unknown User"
**Impact**: Low - functionality works, just display issue
**Root Cause**: Comment data loading doesn't structure user data as nested object
**Status**: Identified - Same fix needed as posts (already fixed for posts)
**Fix Required**: Update comment loading to structure user data as nested object

**Note**: Post user names were fixed successfully and now display correctly!
